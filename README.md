## Documentation

For documentation, add this package as Swift Package Dependency,
and click `Product -> Build Documentation` from the menubar, or
`⋀⇧⌘D` as a shortcut. A documentation window will open on
successful build. If you accidentally closed it - no worries!
Just click `Help -> Developer Documentation` from the menubar,
or `⇧⌘0` (that's a zero) as a shortcut.

## Platform support

This project supports macOS and Linux, with other platforms like
iOS, watchOS, and tvOS coming soon.

---

## Dependancies

You can use `brew` to install Lua prior to adding the Swift Package. Simply run:

```
brew install lua
```

You should do this before opening Xcode and adding the Swift Package.
